# Memoire Community Notes

Community Memoire Notes are markdown skill packs that extend `@memi-design/cli` with reviewed design, research, agent, MCP, Studio, and sandbox workflows.

This repo is the community side of the memi ecosystem:

| Surface | Link | What it carries |
| --- | --- | --- |
| npm engine | [`@memi-design/cli`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@memi-design/cli) | `memi` CLI, app-quality audits, interface craft, shadcn registry export, Notes, and MCP server. |
| Engine repo | [`sarveshsea/memi`](https://github.com/sarveshsea/memi) | Source for the npm package, built-in Notes, Agent Skills, Codex plugin, release gates, and docs. |
| MCP server | [`server.json`](https://github.com/sarveshsea/memi/blob/main/server.json) | Registry-safe stdio entrypoint: `memi mcp start --no-figma`. |
| Agent Skills | [`skills/memoire-design-tooling`](https://github.com/sarveshsea/memi/tree/main/skills/memoire-design-tooling) | Installable skill package for design-aware coding agents. |
| macOS Studio | [`sarveshsea/memi-studio`](https://github.com/sarveshsea/memi-studio) | Tauri/Rust-backed macOS workbench for supervised Codex and Claude Code product-design runs. |
| Proof sandbox | [`sarveshsea/design-sandbox`](https://github.com/sarveshsea/design-sandbox) | Public Next.js/Tailwind/shadcn workspace wired for memi, MCP, Agent Skills, and proof commands. |
| Community Notes | [`sarveshsea/memoire-community-notes`](https://github.com/sarveshsea/memoire-community-notes) | Reviewed community skill packs published into the community Notes catalog. |

| `interface-craft-gate` | Makes `memi craft audit` part of the first-class interface design craft loop. |

## Note structure

Each package lives at `notes/<note-name>/` and contains:

- `note.json` with Memoire Note metadata
- one or more markdown skill files referenced by `note.json`
- optional resources that are never executed during install

## Review rules

Community Notes must include:

- kebab-case `name`
- semver `version`
- `sourceUrls`
- `lastResearchedAt`
- `freshnessDays`
- safe relative markdown skill paths
- no install-time scripts

Installs do not execute scripts from downloaded archives. Any resource files are treated as passive content until a human or agent reviews them.
