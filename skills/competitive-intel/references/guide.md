## Competitive Landscape Mapping

### Competitor Identification

#### Tier 1 — Direct Competitors
Same problem, same target audience, same business model.

Identification methods:
- Search the exact problem statement on Google, Product Hunt, G2
- Check "Alternatives to [product]" pages on G2, Capterra, AlternativeTo
- Monitor the same keywords in App Store / Play Store
- Track who bids on the same paid search terms (SpyFu, SEMrush)
- Ask sales team who they lose deals to

Capture for each:
- Company name, URL, founding year
- Funding stage and total raised (Crunchbase)
- Estimated team size (LinkedIn)
- Estimated revenue range (if public: SEC filings; if private: employee count heuristic)
- Primary positioning statement (from homepage hero)
- Target persona (from their marketing copy)

#### Tier 2 — Indirect Competitors
Same problem, different audience or different approach.

Examples: A B2B analytics tool competes indirectly with spreadsheets, custom SQL dashboards, and consulting firms that deliver reports manually.

Identification methods:
- Think about how the problem was solved before your category existed
- Look at what users were doing before they adopted your product (ask in onboarding)
- Check adjacent categories on G2/Capterra
- Monitor "I use X instead of Y" discussions on Reddit, HN, Twitter

#### Tier 3 — Adjacent Competitors
Different problem, same audience. They compete for budget and attention.

Identification methods:
- Map the full tool stack of your ideal customer
- Identify which tools are expanding toward your space
- Watch for platform plays that bundle your feature as one of many
- Track partnerships and integrations in your ecosystem

#### Tier 4 — Aspirational Benchmarks
Best-in-class from any industry. Not competitors — references for excellence.

Selection criteria:
- Best onboarding experience (regardless of industry)
- Best data visualization approach
- Best mobile experience
- Best accessibility implementation
- Best pricing page design
- Best documentation / help system
- Best community engagement model

### Building the Competitor Registry

Store each competitor as a research insight in Memoire:

```
Tag format: competitor:{name}, tier:{1|2|3|4}, segment:{segment}
```

Minimum fields per competitor entry:
- `name`: Company name
- `url`: Primary product URL
- `tier`: 1-4 classification
- `positioning`: Their one-line value proposition
- `targetPersona`: Who they sell to
- `pricingModel`: Free, freemium, subscription, usage-based, enterprise
- `pricingRange`: Low end to high end
- `fundingStage`: Bootstrap, seed, series A-F, public
- `teamSize`: Estimated headcount
- `techStack`: Known technologies (from BuiltWith, job postings)
- `strengths`: Top 3 perceived strengths
- `weaknesses`: Top 3 perceived weaknesses
- `lastUpdated`: Date of last review

---

## Positioning Map

### Axis Selection

The positioning map is a 2x2 matrix. Axis selection determines the strategic
insight you extract. Choose axes that reveal meaningful gaps.

#### Common Axis Pairs

| X-Axis | Y-Axis | Reveals |
|--------|--------|---------|
| Price (low to high) | Feature breadth (narrow to broad) | Value positioning |
| Simplicity (simple to complex) | Power (basic to advanced) | Usability vs capability tradeoff |
| Consumer focus to Enterprise focus | Vertical (niche) to Horizontal (general) | Market segment strategy |
| Self-serve to Sales-led | SMB to Enterprise | Go-to-market approach |
| Design quality (low to high) | Technical depth (shallow to deep) | Craft investment |
| Time to value (slow to fast) | Customizability (rigid to flexible) | Onboarding strategy |
| Community-driven to Company-driven | Open source to Proprietary | Ecosystem model |

#### Custom Axis Construction

For industry-specific maps, construct axes from your product's key differentiators:

1. List your top 5 differentiators
2. List your top 5 weaknesses
3. Create axes where you land in a favorable quadrant
4. Validate: do competitors spread across all 4 quadrants? If they cluster, the axes are not discriminating enough

### Plotting

Score each competitor 1-10 on each axis. Place on the map. Then:

1. **Identify clusters** — crowded quadrants mean commoditized positions
2. **Identify white space** — empty quadrants are either opportunities or dead zones
3. **Validate white space** — is the empty quadrant empty because nobody wants to be there, or because nobody has figured it out yet?
4. **Draw movement arrows** — where are competitors heading based on recent moves?

### Output as Memoire DataViz Spec

Generate a scatter plot spec:

```json
{
  "specType": "dataviz",
  "vizType": "scatter",
  "title": "Competitive Positioning Map",
  "axes": {
    "x": { "label": "{axis-label}", "min": 0, "max": 10 },
    "y": { "label": "{axis-label}", "min": 0, "max": 10 }
  },
  "dataPoints": [
    { "label": "Us", "x": 7, "y": 8, "size": "large", "color": "primary" },
    { "label": "Competitor A", "x": 5, "y": 6, "size": "medium", "color": "neutral" }
  ],
  "quadrantLabels": {
    "topRight": "Leaders",
    "topLeft": "Specialists",
    "bottomRight": "Disruptors",
    "bottomLeft": "Commodities"
  }
}
```

## Feature Matrix Framework

### Structure

Organize features into categories. Each category contains 5-15 discrete features.

#### Standard Category Template

| Category | Feature | Us | Comp A | Comp B | Comp C | Weight |
|----------|---------|-----|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| Core | {feature} | {status} | {status} | {status} | {status} | {1-5} |

#### Status Values

| Status | Symbol | Meaning |
|--------|--------|---------|
| `full` | ● | Complete, production-ready implementation |
| `partial` | ◐ | Exists but limited — missing key sub-features |
| `beta` | ◑ | Available but not stable / feature-flagged |
| `planned` | ○ | On public roadmap or confirmed by company |
| `none` | — | Not available, no indication it's coming |
| `unique` | ★ | Only this competitor offers it |
| `deprecated` | ✕ | Was available, being removed |

#### Numeric Scoring (for weighted analysis)

Convert status to numeric for calculations:
- `full` = 1.0
- `partial` = 0.5
- `beta` = 0.3
- `planned` = 0.1
- `none` = 0.0
- `unique` = 1.0 (with bonus flag)
- `deprecated` = 0.0

### Universal Feature Categories

These categories apply across most SaaS products. Select the ones relevant
to the product under analysis.

1. **Core Functionality** — the primary jobs-to-be-done features
2. **User Management** — auth, roles, permissions, teams, SSO
3. **Data & Analytics** — dashboards, reports, exports, custom queries
4. **Integrations** — native integrations, API, webhooks, Zapier
5. **Collaboration** — sharing, commenting, real-time editing, notifications
6. **Customization** — theming, white-labeling, custom fields, workflows
7. **Mobile** — native apps, responsive web, offline support
8. **Security** — encryption, compliance (SOC2, GDPR), audit logs
9. **Performance** — speed, uptime SLA, scalability
10. **Support** — docs, chat, phone, SLA, community
11. **AI / Automation** — AI features, workflow automation, smart defaults
12. **Developer Experience** — API quality, SDKs, CLI, documentation
13. **Pricing Flexibility** — free tier, trials, usage-based, annual discounts

### Analysis Patterns

After completing the matrix, run these analyses:

#### Gap Analysis
```
For each feature where we = "none" and any competitor = "full":
  → Priority = feature_weight * count_of_competitors_with_full
  → Sort by priority descending
  → Top 5 = critical gaps to address
```

#### Differentiation Analysis
```
For each feature where we = "full" and all competitors = "none" or "partial":
  → This is a differentiator
  → Validate: do customers actually care about this?
  → If yes: double down, make it prominent in positioning
  → If no: potential over-investment, consider reallocating
```

#### Table Stakes Identification
```
For each feature where ALL competitors (including us) = "full":
  → This is table stakes
  → Do not compete on this — just maintain parity
  → Do not emphasize in marketing (everyone has it)
```

#### Emerging Feature Detection
```
For each feature where exactly 1-2 competitors = "full" or "beta":
  → This is an emerging pattern
  → Evaluate: is this a real trend or an experiment?
  → If 2+ competitors ship it within 6 months: likely trend
  → Decision: fast-follow, leapfrog, or intentionally skip
```

#### Competitive Score Calculation
```
For each competitor:
  score = SUM(feature_status_numeric * feature_weight) / SUM(feature_weight)
  → Normalize to 0-100
  → Compare scores across competitors
  → Track score changes over time (quarterly)
```

### Output as Memoire ComponentSpec

Generate an interactive comparison table:

```json
{
  "specType": "component",
  "atomicLevel": "organism",
  "name": "FeatureComparisonMatrix",
  "description": "Interactive feature comparison table with filtering and sorting",
  "props": {
    "categories": "FeatureCategory[]",
    "competitors": "Competitor[]",
    "highlightGaps": "boolean",
    "showScores": "boolean"
  },
  "composesSpecs": ["DataTable", "Badge", "Tooltip", "FilterBar"]
}
```

## UX Benchmarking

### Heuristic Evaluation Framework

Evaluate each competitor against an extended heuristic set. Score each
heuristic 1-5 for each competitor.

#### Nielsen's 10 Heuristics (Extended to 15)

| # | Heuristic | What to Evaluate | Score Guide |
|---|-----------|-------------------|-------------|
| 1 | Visibility of system status | Loading states, progress indicators, sync status, real-time feedback | 5=instant feedback everywhere, 1=silent failures |
| 2 | Match between system and real world | Language, metaphors, icon clarity, mental model alignment | 5=speaks user's language, 1=developer jargon |
| 3 | User control and freedom | Undo/redo, cancel flows, back navigation, draft saving | 5=full undo everywhere, 1=destructive actions with no escape |
| 4 | Consistency and standards | Internal consistency, platform conventions, design system adherence | 5=pixel-perfect consistency, 1=every page feels different |
| 5 | Error prevention | Confirmation dialogs, input validation, smart defaults, constraints | 5=impossible to make mistakes, 1=errors easy to trigger |
| 6 | Recognition over recall | Visible options, recent items, search, contextual help | 5=everything discoverable, 1=must memorize paths |
| 7 | Flexibility and efficiency | Keyboard shortcuts, bulk actions, customization, power user paths | 5=expert and novice paths, 1=one rigid workflow |
| 8 | Aesthetic and minimalist design | Visual clarity, information density, whitespace, typography | 5=every pixel earns its place, 1=cluttered and noisy |
| 9 | Error recovery | Error messages quality, recovery suggestions, data preservation | 5=helpful messages with fix actions, 1=generic error codes |
| 10 | Help and documentation | In-app help, tooltips, docs quality, search, tutorials | 5=comprehensive and contextual, 1=no help available |
| 11 | Accessibility | WCAG level, screen reader support, keyboard nav, color contrast | 5=AAA compliant, 1=fails basic checks |
| 12 | Performance | Page load, interaction responsiveness, animation smoothness | 5=instant everything, 1=perceptible lag on every action |
| 13 | Trust and credibility | Security indicators, social proof, transparency, data ownership | 5=clearly trustworthy, 1=feels sketchy |
| 14 | Onboarding and learnability | Time to first value, guided tours, progressive disclosure | 5=productive in minutes, 1=requires training |
| 15 | Emotional design | Delight moments, personality, micro-interactions, brand feeling | 5=memorable and enjoyable, 1=purely utilitarian |

#### Scoring Protocol

For each heuristic per competitor:
1. Spend 10-15 minutes evaluating that specific heuristic
2. Document 2-3 specific observations (positive or negative)
3. Capture screenshots of notable examples
4. Assign score 1-5 with brief justification
5. Flag any "best in class" examples worth emulating

### Task-Based Comparison

#### Defining Core Tasks

Select 5-7 tasks that represent the primary user journey. Tasks should be:
- Specific and completable (not "use the product")
- Representative of different journey stages
- Measurable (clear start and end point)

Example task set for a project management tool:
1. Create a new project with 3 tasks
2. Assign a task to a team member
3. Track progress on a multi-step project
4. Generate a status report
5. Find and resolve an overdue task
6. Set up an automated workflow
7. Invite and onboard a new team member

#### Task Execution Protocol

For each task on each competitor:

```
Task: {task_name}
Competitor: {competitor_name}
Date: {date}

Steps taken:
1. {step}
2. {step}
...

Metrics:
- Steps to complete: {number}
- Time to complete: {seconds}
- Errors encountered: {number}
- Confusion points: {number}
- Help needed: {yes/no, what kind}

Scores (1-5):
- Effectiveness: {did I complete it?}
- Efficiency: {how fast/few steps?}
- Satisfaction: {how did it feel?}
- Learnability: {could I do it again faster?}

Notable observations:
- {positive or negative patterns}

Screenshots:
- {paths to captured screenshots}
```

#### Aggregate Scoring

```
Per competitor:
  Task Score = (effectiveness * 0.4) + (efficiency * 0.3) + (satisfaction * 0.2) + (learnability * 0.1)
  Overall UX Score = average of all task scores
  Normalize to 0-100
```

### Design Pattern Audit

Examine these specific patterns across all competitors:

#### Navigation Architecture
- Primary navigation style: sidebar, top bar, bottom bar, hamburger
- Navigation depth: how many clicks to deepest content
- Search: global search presence, quality, filters
- Breadcrumbs: presence and accuracy
- Information architecture: how many top-level sections

#### Onboarding Flow
- Account creation: steps, required fields, social login options
- First-run experience: guided tour, checklist, sample data, empty states
- Time to value: minutes from signup to first meaningful action
- Activation triggers: what do they consider "activated"
- Progressive disclosure: how do they introduce advanced features over time

#### Empty States
- First-time empty states: illustration, CTA, guidance
- Data-dependent empty states: what shows when a filter returns nothing
- Error empty states: connection lost, permission denied
- Emotional tone: encouraging, neutral, or sterile

#### Data Visualization
- Chart types used and appropriateness
- Interactivity: hover, click, drill-down, filter
- Responsiveness: how charts adapt to mobile / small screens
- Accessibility: alt text, color-blind safe palettes, data tables
- Export options: PNG, SVG, CSV, PDF

#### Settings and Configuration
- Organization: flat list, categorized, searchable
- Discoverability: can users find what they need
- Dangerous actions: how are destructive settings protected
- Default values: are defaults sensible for new users

#### Pricing Page Patterns
- Number of tiers: typically 3-4
- Tier naming conventions
- Feature comparison presentation
- CTA placement and wording
- FAQ section presence
- Enterprise / custom tier handling
- Annual vs monthly toggle
- Free tier or trial presentation

- Does the metric align with the value the customer receives?
- Is it predictable for buyers? (seats = predictable; events = variable)
- Does it create expansion revenue naturally?

### Switching Cost Assessment

For each competitor, evaluate what it takes for a user to leave:

| Switching Factor | Low | Medium | High |
|-----------------|-----|--------|------|
| Data export | Full export available | Partial / manual | Locked in |
| Integration dependencies | Few / standard | Moderate | Deep / custom |
| Team retraining | Minimal | Moderate | Significant |
| Contract lock-in | Monthly | Annual | Multi-year |
| Data format | Open / standard | Proprietary but convertible | Proprietary and locked |

## Anti-Patterns and Quality Checks

### Analysis Anti-Patterns

| Anti-Pattern | Why It Fails | Correction |
|-------------|-------------|------------|
| Feature counting without weighting | Not all features matter equally | Weight by user impact and strategic importance |
| Using marketing copy as data | Marketing overstates and misdirects | Verify every claim by using the product |
| Ignoring indirect competitors | Disruption comes from adjacent spaces | Always include Tier 2 and Tier 3 competitors |
| Static one-time analysis | Markets move; stale data misleads | Follow the monitoring cadence above |
| Focusing only on weaknesses | Misses what competitors do well that we should learn from | Document strengths with same rigor as weaknesses |
| Confirmation bias in scoring | Tendency to score self high, competitors low | Use blind scoring or have multiple raters |
| Ignoring free/open-source alternatives | OSS competitors erode willingness to pay | Include relevant OSS in Tier 2 |
| Depth-blind comparison | Marking "full" when implementation is shallow | Evaluate implementation quality, not just presence |
| Ignoring ecosystem and community | Community moats are real competitive advantages | Track GitHub stars, Discord/Slack size, forum activity |
| Analysis without action | Reports that don't lead to decisions are waste | Every analysis must end with recommended moves |

### Quality Checklist

Before finalizing any competitive analysis:

- [ ] All Tier 1 competitors identified and profiled
- [ ] At least 3 Tier 2 (indirect) competitors included
- [ ] Feature matrix verified by actually using each product (not just reading marketing)
- [ ] UX scores based on hands-on evaluation, not assumptions
- [ ] Pricing data current (checked within last 30 days)
- [ ] Screenshots captured for all notable patterns
- [ ] Data sources documented for every claim
- [ ] Insights tagged and stored in Memoire research system
- [ ] Strategic recommendations are specific and actionable (not "improve onboarding" but "add guided tour for first 3 tasks within 30 days")
- [ ] Report reviewed for confirmation bias — are we being honest about competitor strengths?
