# Web Research — Memoire Research Skill

This skill drives structured web research from topic definition through
validated findings. Every section maps to concrete deliverables that feed
Memoire's research, spec, and codegen pipelines.

---

## Quick Reference — Research Depth Levels

| Depth | Queries | Sources | Time | When to Use |
|-------|---------|---------|------|-------------|
| `quick` | 2-3 focused queries | 5-8 sources | 15 min | Spot check, single question, fact verification |
| `standard` | 5-7 queries across angles | 10-20 sources | 45 min | Feature research, pattern discovery, general exploration |
| `deep` | 10-15 queries with refinement | 25-50 sources | 2+ hours | Comprehensive analysis, market mapping, trend identification |

### Depth Selection Guide

| Situation | Recommended Depth | Rationale |
|-----------|------------------|-----------|
| "What is the standard pattern for X?" | quick | Single factual answer |
| "What are best practices for checkout flows?" | standard | Multiple perspectives needed |
| "Full competitive landscape for design tools" | deep | Breadth and depth required |
| Validating a specific claim | quick | Confirmation from 2-3 sources |
| Informing a design decision | standard | Need options and tradeoffs |
| Building a research report for stakeholders | deep | Comprehensive coverage expected |
| Checking a regulatory requirement | standard | Need authoritative sources |
| Exploring an unfamiliar domain | deep | Unknown unknowns require breadth |

---

## Query Strategy by Depth

### Quick Depth — Focused Queries

```
Strategy: Precision over breadth.
Queries: 2-3 highly specific search terms.
Goal: Find the direct answer with minimal noise.

Example topic: "best practice for form validation timing"
  Query 1: "form validation timing UX best practice"
  Query 2: "inline validation vs on-submit validation research"
  Query 3: "form validation user experience guidelines"
```

### Standard Depth — Multi-Angle Queries

```
Strategy: Cover the topic from multiple perspectives.
Queries: 5-7 queries, each targeting a different angle.
Goal: Build a well-rounded understanding.

Example topic: "e-commerce checkout optimization"
  Query 1: "e-commerce checkout best practices 2026"
  Query 2: "checkout abandonment causes research data"
  Query 3: "one-page vs multi-step checkout conversion"
  Query 4: "guest checkout vs account creation impact"
  Query 5: "mobile checkout UX patterns"
  Query 6: "checkout form design accessibility"
  Query 7: "payment method selection UI patterns"
```

### Deep Depth — Exhaustive Coverage

```
Strategy: Systematic coverage with iterative refinement.
Queries: 10-15 queries, with follow-up queries based on findings.
Goal: Leave no significant angle unexplored.

Phase 1 — Broad exploration (5 queries):
  Cover the main topic from obvious angles.

Phase 2 — Fill gaps (3-5 queries):
  Based on Phase 1 findings, identify missing perspectives.
  Target specific sub-topics that emerged.

Phase 3 — Validate and deepen (2-5 queries):
  Cross-check key claims from Phase 1-2.
  Dive deep into the most impactful findings.
  Search for contradicting evidence.
```

## Providing URLs for Research

Users can provide specific URLs for the agent to analyze alongside
web search results.

### CLI Commands

```bash
# Topic-based web research (agent searches for sources)
memi research web "e-commerce checkout optimization"

# Topic with specific URLs to include
memi research web "checkout optimization" --urls https://baymard.com/checkout,https://nngroup.com/checkout

# URL-only analysis (no additional search)
memi research web --urls https://example.com/article1,https://example.com/article2

# With depth control
memi research web "design system trends" --depth deep

# With focus categories
memi research web "design system trends" --depth deep --focus competitor-insight,design-pattern

# With output label
memi research web "checkout optimization" --label "Checkout Redesign Research"

# Batch: research multiple topics
memi research web --batch topics.txt
```

### URL Handling

When URLs are provided:

```
1. FETCH — retrieve the page content
2. STRIP — remove navigation, ads, footers, scripts
3. EXTRACT — pull article body, headings, lists, data tables
4. SCORE — relevance to the research topic (0.0-1.0)
5. PROCESS — run through the standard finding extraction pipeline
```

URLs are treated as high-priority sources. They are always included in
the final findings regardless of relevance score (user intent overrides
algorithmic filtering).

---

## Content Processing Pipeline

### Stage 1 — Fetch

```
Input: URL
Output: Raw HTML

Methods:
  - Direct HTTP GET for public pages
  - MCP host fetch for pages requiring JavaScript rendering
  - Cached responses honored (304 Not Modified)
  - Timeout: 15 seconds per URL
  - Retry: 1 retry on timeout or 5xx
  - User-Agent: standard browser UA string

Error handling:
  - 403/401: log as "access denied", skip
  - 404: log as "not found", skip
  - 429: wait and retry once, then skip
  - Network error: log, skip
  - All errors are non-fatal — research continues with available sources
```

### Stage 2 — Strip HTML

```
Input: Raw HTML
Output: Clean text with structure markers

Remove:
  - <script>, <style>, <noscript> elements
  - Navigation bars, headers, footers (heuristic: <nav>, <header>, <footer>)
  - Sidebars (<aside>, elements with "sidebar" class)
  - Ads (elements with "ad", "advertisement", "sponsored" classes)
  - Cookie banners
  - Social share widgets
  - Comment sections

Preserve:
  - <article> or <main> content (priority container)
  - Headings (h1-h6) with hierarchy
  - Paragraphs
  - Lists (ordered and unordered)
  - Tables (as structured data)
  - Blockquotes
  - Code blocks
  - Image alt text (as "[Image: {alt text}]")
```

### Stage 3 — Extract Paragraphs

```
Input: Clean text with structure
Output: Array of content blocks

Each block:
  {
    "type": "heading" | "paragraph" | "list" | "table" | "blockquote" | "code",
    "level": 1-6 (for headings),
    "text": "{content}",
    "wordCount": {number},
    "position": {0.0-1.0 normalized position in document}
  }

Filter out:
  - Blocks with fewer than 10 words (likely navigation fragments)
  - Duplicate blocks (exact match)
  - Boilerplate blocks (copyright notices, "all rights reserved", etc.)
```

### Stage 4 — Score Relevance

```
Input: Array of content blocks + research topic
Output: Blocks with relevance scores

Scoring factors:
  - Keyword overlap with research topic (0.0-1.0)
  - Semantic similarity to topic (0.0-1.0)
  - Position boost: earlier content scored slightly higher
  - Heading context: blocks under relevant headings scored higher
  - Source authority: known authoritative domains scored higher

Relevance thresholds:
  - >= 0.7: High relevance — always include
  - 0.4-0.7: Medium relevance — include if under source limit
  - < 0.4: Low relevance — exclude unless specifically requested
```

### Stage 5 — Categorize Findings

```
Input: Relevant content blocks
Output: Categorized findings

Each finding is classified into exactly one category (see Finding Categories below).
Classification is based on:
  - Language patterns (prescriptive = best-practice, data-bearing = market-data)
  - Content structure (numbered lists often = best practices, percentages = market data)
  - Source type (research papers = user-need, competitor blogs = competitor-insight)
  - Topic alignment (regulatory language = regulatory, technical specs = technical-constraint)
```

### Stage 6 — Cross-Validate

```
Input: All categorized findings across all sources
Output: Findings with confidence scores

Validation rules:
  - Finding mentioned in 1 source: confidence = low (0.3)
  - Finding mentioned in 2 sources: confidence = medium (0.6)
  - Finding mentioned in 3+ sources: confidence = high (0.9)
  - Finding from authoritative source (research institution, standards body): +0.2 boost
  - Finding contradicted by another source: flag as "disputed", include both perspectives
```

---

## Finding Categories

Every extracted finding is classified into one of these categories.

| Category | Code | Description | Example |
|----------|------|-------------|---------|
| Best Practice | `best-practice` | Established convention or recommended approach | "Always show progress indicators during multi-step forms" |
| User Need | `user-need` | Documented user requirement or expectation | "Users expect checkout to complete in under 60 seconds" |
| Pain Point | `pain-point` | Known frustration or usability issue | "52% of users abandon carts when forced to create an account" |
| Market Data | `market-data` | Statistics, metrics, growth figures | "Global e-commerce conversion rate averages 2.86% in 2026" |
| Design Pattern | `design-pattern` | Reusable UI/UX pattern with documented usage | "Progressive disclosure in settings reduces cognitive load" |
| Technical Constraint | `technical-constraint` | Platform, browser, or infrastructure limitation | "Safari does not support the Payment Request API on macOS" |
| Competitor Insight | `competitor-insight` | Information about a specific competitor's approach | "Shopify checkout uses a single-page layout with accordion sections" |
| Regulatory | `regulatory` | Legal, compliance, or accessibility requirement | "PSD2 requires Strong Customer Authentication for EU payments" |

### Category Distribution Targets

For a well-rounded research output, aim for this distribution:

| Category | Target % | If Under-Represented |
|----------|----------|---------------------|
| best-practice | 20-30% | Add queries: "{topic} best practices", "{topic} guidelines" |
| user-need | 15-25% | Add queries: "{topic} user research", "{topic} user expectations" |
| pain-point | 10-20% | Add queries: "{topic} problems", "{topic} complaints", "{topic} abandonment" |
| market-data | 10-15% | Add queries: "{topic} statistics 2026", "{topic} market data" |
| design-pattern | 15-25% | Add queries: "{topic} UI patterns", "{topic} design examples" |
| technical-constraint | 5-10% | Add queries: "{topic} browser support", "{topic} limitations" |
| competitor-insight | 5-15% | Add queries: "how {competitor} handles {topic}" |
| regulatory | 5-10% | Add queries: "{topic} compliance", "{topic} legal requirements" |

---

## Cross-Validation Methodology

### Confidence Levels

| Level | Sources Required | Label | Color Code |
|-------|-----------------|-------|------------|
| Low | 1 source | `unverified` | muted |
| Medium | 2 sources | `corroborated` | default |
| High | 3+ sources | `validated` | primary |
| Authoritative | Standards body or research institution | `authoritative` | accent |
| Disputed | Contradicting sources found | `disputed` | warning |

### Validation Protocol

```
For each finding:

1. IDENTIFY — extract the core claim (strip subjective language)
2. SEARCH — look for the same claim in other processed sources
3. MATCH — determine if other findings support, contradict, or are neutral
4. SCORE — assign confidence based on match count and source authority
5. FLAG — mark disputed findings with both perspectives
```

### Source Authority Ranking

| Source Type | Authority Score | Examples |
|-------------|----------------|---------|
| Research institution | 1.0 | Nielsen Norman Group, Baymard Institute, Forrester |
| Standards body | 1.0 | W3C, WCAG, ISO, PCI DSS |
| Academic paper | 0.9 | Peer-reviewed UX research, HCI conferences |
| Industry report | 0.8 | Gartner, McKinsey, Deloitte research |
| Established publication | 0.7 | Smashing Magazine, A List Apart, UX Collective |
| Company blog (large) | 0.5 | Google, Apple, Shopify engineering blogs |
| Personal blog (expert) | 0.4 | Recognized practitioners with track record |
| Forum / discussion | 0.3 | Stack Overflow, Reddit, Hacker News |
| Company blog (small) | 0.2 | Unknown company marketing content |
| Content farm | 0.1 | SEO-driven content, thin articles |

## Entity Extraction

### Extractable Entity Types

The research pipeline extracts named entities from processed content.

| Entity Type | Detection Pattern | Example |
|-------------|------------------|---------|
| Product name | Proper noun + context (company, tool, platform) | "Figma", "Stripe", "Shopify" |
| Company name | Proper noun + org context | "Google", "Apple", "Baymard Institute" |
| Technology | Known tech terms, framework names | "React", "WebSocket", "Payment Request API" |
| Standard | Acronym + standards context | "WCAG 2.2", "PCI DSS", "PSD2", "SOC 2" |
| Percentage | `\d+(\.\d+)?%` | "52% of users", "3.2% conversion rate" |
| Dollar amount | `\$[\d,]+(\.\d+)?[BMK]?` | "$4.2B market size", "$49/month" |
| Time metric | Duration patterns | "under 3 seconds", "60-second checkout" |
| Person | Proper noun + role/title context | "Jakob Nielsen", "Vitaly Friedman" |

### Entity Output Format

```json
{
  "entities": [
    {
      "text": "Baymard Institute",
      "type": "company",
      "frequency": 7,
      "context": "research authority on e-commerce UX",
      "firstMention": "source-003"
    },
    {
      "text": "52%",
      "type": "percentage",
      "context": "cart abandonment rate when forced account creation",
      "source": "source-005",
      "confidence": "high"
    }
  ]
}
```

---

## Gap Analysis

After processing all findings, run gap analysis to identify what is
missing from the research.

### Gap Detection Protocol

```
1. INVENTORY — count findings per category
2. COMPARE — check against target distribution (see Category Distribution Targets)
3. IDENTIFY — flag categories with fewer findings than target
4. RECOMMEND — suggest additional queries to fill gaps
5. ASSESS — determine if gaps are acceptable (some topics naturally have fewer regulatory findings)
```

### Gap Report Format

```json
{
  "gapAnalysis": {
    "totalFindings": 47,
    "categoryDistribution": {
      "best-practice": { "count": 14, "percentage": 29.8, "target": "20-30%", "status": "adequate" },

Agent Plan:
  Depth: standard (7 queries)
  Focus: best-practice, design-pattern, competitor-insight
  Output: findings.json + summary.md

Query Set:
  1. "design system documentation best practices 2026"
  2. "how to document design system components"
  3. "design system documentation tools comparison"
  4. "component documentation examples Storybook Docusaurus"
  5. "design system governance documentation"
  6. "design token documentation patterns"

## Anti-Patterns and Quality Checks

### Research Anti-Patterns

| Anti-Pattern | Problem | Correction |
|-------------|---------|------------|
| Single-source findings | No validation, may be incorrect | Require 2+ sources for medium confidence |
| SEO content as authority | Thin content ranks well but lacks substance | Check source authority score, prefer research institutions |
| Recency bias | Ignoring established principles for new trends | Include both recent and foundational sources |
| Confirmation bias | Only searching for evidence that supports a hypothesis | Explicitly search for contradicting evidence |
| Depth without breadth | Deep dive on one angle, missing the full picture | Use the category distribution targets to check coverage |
| Breadth without depth | Surface-level findings on many topics | For standard/deep depth, ensure at least 3 high-confidence findings per key category |
| Ignoring contradictions | Presenting a false consensus | Flag disputed findings, present both sides |
| Outdated data | Statistics from years ago presented as current | Always check publication date, prefer data from last 2 years |

### Quality Checklist

Before finalizing web research output:

- [ ] All finding categories have adequate representation (or gaps are documented)
- [ ] High-confidence findings are supported by 3+ sources
- [ ] Disputed findings are flagged with both perspectives
- [ ] Source authority scores are reasonable (no content farms treated as authoritative)
- [ ] Entities are correctly extracted and typed
- [ ] Statistics include source attribution and date
- [ ] Gap analysis is complete with suggested follow-up queries
- [ ] Summary is readable without referencing the raw findings
- [ ] Insights are tagged correctly for Memoire pipeline integration
- [ ] No broken URLs in the source registry
