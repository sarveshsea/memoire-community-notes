# Cron Agent Workflows

Turn repeatable agent work into scheduled jobs with explicit outputs and safe permissions.

## When to Use

Use this Note when a Memoire or Studio run needs scheduled agent, cron workflow, recurring report, automated run.

## Workflow

1. Define schedule, workspace, model, permission mode, output channel, and stop condition up front.
2. Make every recurring job idempotent and safe to rerun after a crash.
3. Prefer read-only monitors unless the task explicitly needs writes.
4. Emit a concise run summary with changed files, external calls, failures, and next action.
5. Keep mutation jobs paused until one manual run proves the prompt, permissions, and artifact path.
