# Motion Performance

Use this Note to keep UI motion and generated video projects fast, accessible,
and renderable.

## Checks

- Animate transform and opacity first; treat layout and paint-heavy properties
  as exceptions that need proof.
- Define fixed dimensions, fps, and duration for video projects before render.
- Keep text within safe crop zones for 16:9, 9:16, and square variants.
- Add reduced-motion alternatives for UI surfaces that embed generated motion.
- Validate exported artifacts for existence, size, and playable MIME type before
  surfacing a download.

## Backend Rules

- Render concurrency should default to one job per Studio runtime.
- Download and render queues need explicit failed states and retry-safe records.
- Use checksums for downloaded Note archives and never run scripts while
  installing a Note.
