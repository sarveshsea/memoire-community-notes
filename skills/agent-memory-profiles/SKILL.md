# Agent Memory Profiles

Design durable user, project, persona, and task memory profiles for local agents.

## When to Use

Use this Note when a Memoire or Studio run needs agent memory profile, persona file, context file, persistent memory.

## Workflow

1. Separate durable identity, user preferences, project rules, and temporary task state.
2. Keep high-authority files small and specific. Long transcripts belong in searchable knowledge stores.
3. Prefer append-only memory updates with date, source, and confidence fields.
4. When migrating memory, preserve provenance and mark stale or unverifiable entries.
5. Review memory before a sensitive run so old preferences do not override current instructions.
