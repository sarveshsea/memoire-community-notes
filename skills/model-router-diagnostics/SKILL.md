# Model Router Diagnostics

Diagnose provider auth, model routing, quota windows, and fallback behavior before agent runs.

## When to Use

Use this Note when a Memoire or Studio run needs model router, provider auth, quota check, fallback model, reasoning setting.

## Workflow

1. List configured providers and default models before starting a long-running session.
2. Check OAuth, API-key, environment, and config-backed credentials separately.
3. Run live probes only when the user accepts token and rate-limit cost.
4. Record fallback order, reasoning effort, sandbox mode, and provider-specific model id.
5. If routing fails, report whether the problem is missing auth, expired auth, unsupported model, or quota.
